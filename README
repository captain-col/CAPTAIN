= Support for the CAPTAIN software =

== Preliminaries ==

The captain software doesn't need any special privileges to install, and is
really intended to be setup in a normal user account.  However, it is easy
to share one installation among several users.  At SBU, the captain
software is setup in a captain group account, and we share the
installation.  Individual users can still have their own work areas.

The software is almost entirely installed for source code, and (as much
effort as possible to make sure) it will install on most generic LINUX
setups.  It does not require a specific version of scientific linux.  The
source code is primarily managed using the SPI tools, in particular, the
CMT code management tool.  

== Configuring the Software ==

This git repository contains the needed support to setup and
install the CAPTAIN software.  It is checked out in the root of a CAPTAIN
installation.  The initial configuration is done by running "configure.sh"
which is in the top level directory.  The software can then be installed by
running "capt-install" to create a directory tree.  As an example, here's
how I install it (creating the work/captain/software directory as needed).
I run bash, and I have a public ssh key set for the caption repository. 

First, configure the software:

cd ${HOME}/work/captain/software
git clone captain@nngroup.physics.sunysb.edu:CAPTAIN
cd CAPTAIN
./configure.sh

This creates files that can be sourced to setup the necessary environment.
If I don't have an ssh key in the captain repository, I replace the git
clone with

git clone http://nngroup.physics.sunysb.edu/~captain/repo/CAPTAIN

This will allow you to pull from the group repository, but not push.  It's
easy to add a key, so if you are planning on working on the software very
much, you should get a key added (ask at the next meeting).

I like to be able to run the setup with an easy command, so I add the
following line to my bashrc file

alias capt-setup=${HOME}/work/captain/software/CAPTAIN/captain.profile

You can have any number of independent captain installations and they won't
interfere with each other.  The only requirement is that they are in
different directories.  You chose which one you used by which
captain.profile you source.

== Installing the Software ==

As of today, March 1, 2013, this section is mostly hypothetical.  

After the CAPTAIN software is configured, you can install a release using
the capt-install command.  You can choose a particular release using the
--release option.  This works like

capt-install

Note that this command will take a long time to run.

== Scripts ==

All of these scripts reside in the CAPTAIN/scripts directory and are placed
in the path when the profile is sourced.  Most of these scripts are
documented by a usage message accessed with "--help".

capt-get-file:: Get a file from the CAPTAIN web page (the tar file
   directory), and place it in the "CAPTAIN/../tar" directory.  This is
   mostly used by the installer to download tar files that will be unpacked
   and installed.

capt-import-tar-file:: Take a tar file as input and add it to a git
   repository on the "upstream" branch.  This takes a version string that
   is used as a tag for the imported changeset.

capt-install:: Install a release of the CAPTAIN software.

capt-install-cmt:: Install CMT into this CAPTAIN release.
