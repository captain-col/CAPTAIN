Usage: capt-track-upstream

    No arguments.  This is run in a local repository to set it up so
that it tracks all of the upstream branchs.  These branches are all in
refs/remotes/origin.  This command can be run multiple times, and it's
a good idea to run it once in a while to make sure that your
.git/config is up to date.
